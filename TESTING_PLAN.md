# Flatastic Testing Plan

## Project Overview

Flatastic is a Next.js-based household management application with features for chore management, expense tracking, household management, and PWA capabilities.

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Tests

- **Components**: Test individual React components in isolation
- **Hooks**: Test custom hooks for data fetching and state management
- **Utilities**: Test helper functions and validation schemas
- **API Routes**: Test backend API endpoints

### 2. Integration Tests

- **User Flows**: Test complete user journeys (login → household → chores/expenses)
- **Data Flow**: Test data fetching, caching, and state updates
- **Authentication**: Test auth flows and protected routes

### 3. E2E Tests (Manual)

- **Cross-browser Testing**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Mobile Testing**: iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile
- **PWA Testing**: Install, offline functionality, push notifications
- **Performance Testing**: Load times, responsiveness

## Test Data Setup

### Mock Users

- Test user with household
- Test user without household
- Admin user
- Regular member user

### Mock Data

- Sample households
- Sample chores
- Sample expenses
- Sample payments

## Performance Benchmarks

### Load Times

- Initial page load: < 3 seconds
- Navigation between pages: < 1 second
- Data fetching: < 2 seconds

### Responsiveness

- Mobile breakpoint: 320px - 768px
- Tablet breakpoint: 768px - 1024px
- Desktop breakpoint: 1024px+

## Accessibility Requirements

### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance

- Color contrast ratios
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader compatibility
- Focus management

### Testing Tools

- Jest for unit/integration tests
- React Testing Library for component tests
- Playwright for E2E tests (future)
- Lighthouse for performance/accessibility

## Test Execution Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- --testPathPattern=use-household

# Run tests matching pattern
npm test -- --testNamePattern="household"
```

## Continuous Integration

### Pre-commit Hooks

- Lint check
- Type check
- Unit tests
- Coverage threshold check

### CI Pipeline

- Install dependencies
- Run linting
- Run type checking
- Run unit tests
- Run integration tests
- Generate coverage report
- Deploy to staging (if tests pass)
